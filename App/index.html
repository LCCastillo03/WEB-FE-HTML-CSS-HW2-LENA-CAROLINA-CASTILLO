                    "The book is a garden that can be carried in a pocket, a spaceship traveling in a backpack, a weapon to face 
                    the best battles and confront the worst enemies, a seed of freedom, a handkerchief for tears. The book is a soft bed and a bed of nails, 
                    the book forces you to think, to smile, to cry, to get angry at injustice and applaud the revenge of the just. 
                    The book is food, shelter, a seat, clothing that wraps me, a mouth that kisses my mouth. A place that contains the universe."
